# Project Management Log

## Project management discussion

*Sprint 3: Pre Planning <br> 
*Progress: As the previous code developed wasn't usable , we have to redo the code again and do the wireframe. <br>
We had more breathing room as the final product requirements changed to one fully functional feature in code and the rest were in wireframe. <br>
We delegated one member to do the wireframe while the rest work on the coding <br>

*Sprint 3: <br> 
*Progress: The team faced some issues while building the feature due to a persistent error that was causing issues <br> 
The wireframe was developed at the end of the sprint <br>
*Although we didnt managed to resolve the problem but the rest of the feature is working fine <br>

*Sprint Review <br>
*Our team have came up with the idea to build a navigation menu that will appear when clicked. It is the most simplest and user friendly solution for the user however it was something brand new for team and took longer than expected to complete and resolve the issue <br>
*The key takeway from this sprint is to give 1-2 days to debug the issue and pivot to a much easier solution like drop dowm menu or anticipate that this task will take a longer time and add more manpower and start earlier in order to complete this task successfully <br>

*Sprint Retrospective <br>  

*During our sprint, we are able to code 90% of our feature and wireframe so we did managed to achieve this goal <br>

*During our sprint, we did encountered a challenge which is an error that caused a part of our program not to work successfuly and a lot of time was spent to debug and solve the problem but at the end of the sprint, we are unable to resolve the issue <br>

*The takewaway from this is to give more time when trying out this new task where our team is totally new and to pivot to an easier solution when we are facing a roadblock and spending lots of time to resolve this issue <br>

*We can encourage the team members to speak freely on what they want to learn/do during the project as it is about team development and developing their skillset over the course of the project such as coding / wireframe <br>

*Our team's communication can be improved during the sprint and more stand up meetings can be conducted  so that we can track the team's progress during the sprint and pivot or think of alternative ways to solve the issue such as add more manpower or brainstorm as a team and pivot to a different solution <br>
