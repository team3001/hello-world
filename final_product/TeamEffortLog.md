### Sprint 3 (University Week 8):
* My task is to develope the student home page with attedance submission function and do the UI Designe for the home page.
* It was set in sprint 3. it took 2 week
* Comments: After that the MVP, the direction of the coding was changed to do only special feature. Hence we decide to make a special function, to be convient and smooth submission for the student prespective. i research on different method, but the first function i want to do was button function. i did a lot of research on how can i implement the onclick function using button. However, the button feature cannot be done the way i wanted. so i decided to chance the method to use the side bar for menu and nav bar for the submission process.
*Output: i managed to implement the both function however one of the hover function wasnt able to function.
