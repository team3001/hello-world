### Sprint 2 (University Week 6):
* ![Link to Task ](Screenshots/)
* My task is to develop a login system using 2FA and authenticator
* It was set in sprint 2 . It took ? hour 
* Comments: After testing both platforms, i decided on the Microsoft platform
* While working on the platform, I realise that Microsoft azure donâ€™t allow us to use the security function. As security is the core purpose of authentication, i decided to drop the platform and research into another platform
* After doing much research and discussion with my team, i started to build the authentication part using google service. 
* As Google service offers a wide array of scopes to enhance the security of a platform, i studied all these scopes so that i can implement it in my code
* Output: I have implement few of these scopes successfully in my test project using the Google Service platform.
